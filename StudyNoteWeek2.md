# Gradient Descent for Multiple Linear Regression

# Feature Scaling
Feature and parameter values
Feature scaling
Mean normalization
Z-score normalization
Standard deviation

# Checking Gradient Descent for Convergence
Make sure gradient descent is working correctly
Learning curve
Iterations needed varies
s
# Choose the Learning Rate
use a minus sign
With a small enough alpha, dJ should decrease on every iteration
