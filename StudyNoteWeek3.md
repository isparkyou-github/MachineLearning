# Classification
## Motivation
â€œbinary classification"
class=category
false: negative class
true: positive class
Decision boundary
logistic regression

## Logistic Regression
Sigmoid Function
Logistic Function
Want outputs between 0 and 1

## Decision Boundary
Non-linear decision boundaries

## Cost Function for Logistic Regression
Squared error cost
Logistic loss function

## Simplified loss function
Maximum likelihood

## Gradient Descent Implementation
Training logistic regression

## The Problem of Overfitting
underfit: high bias
overfit: high variance
just right: generalization

## Addressing Overfitting
1. Collect more training examples
2. Select features to include/exclude
3. Reduce size of parameters-"Regularization"

## Cost Function with Regularization
